1, 1, and 1.
The 3 1 4 2s.
1 is a 3 1...
The 1 2s.
6, it still 2s 4.
6, again I say 6!
The 1 2s like the 3 1.
The 1 that no one 2s—
5 the 3 1—
1 is not 3.
Why does the 1 2?
Two times 1 was—
5 the 1 of 1—
Is not the 1 4 3?
6, 1!
The 3 1.
2 4 like the 3 1.
3 the 1—
But, never can I 2...
The 1 is of another 1.
1 2s 4 more.
1 does 2...
The 1 2s like a 3 1.
Where is the 3 1?
Was I not 5 1?
With 1, and two times 3.
A 1 2s 5...
